general map specifications:
-the windows size must be 2000x1200 pixels
-the world map is 10000x5400 pixels, scrollable via camera.
-the camera scrolls when the mouse reaches the screen edge (30px margin) or using arrow keys.
-the game is over when all AI buildings and combat units are destroyed (victory), or if all player units and buildings are destroyed (defeat).
-Yanuses wave enemies exist but are currently disabled.
-the game runs at 2x simulation speed.
-the player starts with 1 town center, 3 workers and 50 ressources.
-there are 10 mineral nodes spread across the left/center of the map, each holding 2500 ressources.

minimap:
-a minimap is displayed in the HUD area (bottom-right corner).
-it shows all units, buildings, mineral nodes, enemies, and AI entities.
-a white rectangle on the minimap indicates the current camera viewport.
-clicking on the minimap moves the viewport to that location.
-click-dragging on the minimap smoothly pans the camera.

units specifications:

All units fires at enemy as soon as they are in range. after the fight is over, units resume moving to their waypoint.
Units cannot use the same space at the same time.
Units cannot spawn in a space used by an existing unit.
When a moving unit reaches a destination occupied by another unit, it stops next to it.
When two moving units collide, one stops and waits until the other has moved away.
When a unit is stuck for more than 0.5 second, it enters a "stuck" state and tries to escape by moving left, right, back-left or back-right.
When a unit is stuck for more than 1 second, it gives up and clears its waypoint.
When a unit is selected, all its stats are displayed in the bottom panel.

the worker:
-has 30 health points
-cost 15 ressources to be built.
-trained from the town center in 4 seconds.
-carries 10 ressources per trip and mines for 2 seconds at a node.
-delivers ressources at the edge of the building, not inside it.
-only one worker can mine a node at a time, others wait for it to finish.
-if the drop-off town center is destroyed, the worker cancels mining.

the soldier:
-has 100 health points
-cost 100 ressources to be built.
-trained from the barracks in 3 seconds.
-Its gun fires 5 times a second and deals 10 HP of damage.
-The firing range is 7 times the size of the unit.

the tank:
-has 500 health points
-moves twice as slow as the soldier
-cost 350 ressources to be built.
-trained from the factory in 6 seconds.
-Its cannon fires 1 round every second and deals 34 HP of damage.
-The firing range is 7 times the size of the unit.

buildings specifications:

-buildings can be attacked and destroyed by enemies.
-all production buildings (town center, barracks, factory) have 200 health points.
-the town center costs 100 ressources to place.
-the barracks costs 50 ressources to place.
-the factory costs 80 ressources to place.
-the defense tower costs 300 ressources to place.

the defense tower:
-has 1000 health points.
-does not produce units.
-automatically targets and fires at enemies within range (200 pixels).
-fires 1.5 shots per second, dealing 25 HP of damage.
-displays a rotating cannon barrel pointing at its target (or upward when idle).
-shows its attack range circle when selected.

AI computer player:
-an AI opponent occupies the right side of the map (town center at ~8000, 280).
-has its own set of 10 mineral nodes, workers, buildings, and combat units.
-all AI entities are drawn with an orange tint to distinguish them from the player.
-AI profile is selected via --ai <name> flag (defaults to "basic"). each profile is a file in ai_profiles/.
-profiles control: think interval, max workers, soldier/tank ratio, attack threshold, garrison ratio, retreat ratio, resource reserve, and whether to build towers.

AI profile "basic":
-follows a build order: workers first, then barracks, then factory, then 2nd town center.
-trains up to 8 workers, maintains a 3:1 soldier/tank ratio.
-scouts before attacking, sends 70% of army to attack while 30% garrisons.
-uses focus fire and retreats when army drops below 30%.
-thinks every 1 second and adapts difficulty based on game progression.

AI profile "defensive":
-trains up to 10 workers for a stronger economy.
-requires 12 combat units before launching an attack (double the basic threshold).
-keeps 50% of army garrisoned at base for defense.
-retreats sooner when outnumbered (40% ratio).
-builds up to 6 defense towers near existing buildings.

A new unit called "Yanuses" is an evil soldier-like enemy unit:
-same HP and damage as the soldier
-spawns from the bottom of the map, starting as a group of 3 with one more enemy added each wave.
-shoots the soldiers, the tanks and the building as soon as they are in range.
-walks toward the nearest player unit or building when nothing is in range.

natural disasters:
-random disasters spawn every 45-90 seconds, affecting all units and buildings on the map.
-meteor strike: 0.5s warning (crosshair), then explosion dealing 50 damage in a 150px radius with particle effects.
-earthquake: lasts 5 seconds, shakes the screen, deals 10 damage to all buildings, slows all units by 50%.
-lightning storm: lasts 8 seconds, random bolts strike units every 1-2 seconds for 40 damage (10 splash within 30px).
-toxic cloud: drifts across the map for 12 seconds, deals 5 damage per second to units within a 200px radius.
